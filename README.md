# Weather_Dashboard_with_API_Integration
Using Qt software, C++, and OpenWeatherMap API to create a weather dashboard that receives data from API and displays weather information 


## Project Objective
Develop a fully operational interface that displays real-time weather data such as temperature, humidity, and forecasts.

## Tools
1. Qt software (includes Qt Designer & Qt Creator)
2. OpenWeatherMap API
3. OpenSSL

## Ideals
### Key features
1. Establishing a connection to the API's URL.
2. Retrieving weather data using the provided API keys.
3. Processing the fetched data for meaningful use.
4. Displaying the processed information clearly on the interface.

## Future Progress
1. Perform a more intuitive UI design with more animation
2. Use other methods besides country code to get the weather information, maybe the longitude and latitude of the location, because the country code has its limitations for some countries.
